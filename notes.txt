- G Daytime Route missing from Church Ave F/G
- feedEntity.id is not consistently the same train between responses
- Trip start/stop times are in HH:MM:SS, but arrival and departure times are in Unix Time (second precision)
- Station arrival and departure times are always the same (G line at least)
- The first trip update is the station the train just left, but the the arrival/departure time at that station can change retroactively.
- The list of data for each train has pairs of corresponding data, instead of combining all of the data for one train. The first group of data has the timing for upcoming stops, the second group of data has the status at the current stop.
- tripUpdate.entity items will either have a stopTimeUpdate property OR a vehicle property.
  - Items with a stopTimeUpdate property show where the train will be at each stop down the line.
  - Items with a vehicle property show where the train is currently, and additional information on some feeds.
- %2F confusion on new api url


Done August 2020:
- Simple server caching


New To Dos August 2020:
- Figure out frontend error: Error: index 7 train has no "tripUpdate" property.
- Trains sometimes go negative on the line toward the next station
- Compare Lat/Lng plots calculated vs actual stoptime update data (check negatives)
- Make a dashboard in Svelte to watch real time data as data
- Figure out why trains log as moving on second identical data update

New To Dos September 2020:
- Generate list of stations in order for each line
- Convert to use ES6 modules for code sharing?
