- G Daytime Route missing from Church Ave F/G
- feedEntity.id is not consistently the same train between responses
- Sorting G by latitude "Hoyt - Schermerhorn Sts" is mis-sorted
- Trip start/stop times are in HH:MM:SS, but arrival and departure times are in Unix Time
- Station arrival and departure times are always the same (G line at least)
- The first trip update is the station the train just left, but the the arrival/departure time at that station can change retroactively.
- The list of data for each train has pairs of corresponding data, instead of combining all of the data for one train. The first group of data has the timing for upcoming stops, the second group of data has the status at the current stop.
- tripUpdate.entity items will either have a stopTimeUpdate property OR a vehicle property.
  - Items with a stopTimeUpdate property show where the train will be at each stop down the line.
  - Items with a vehicle property show where the train is currently, and additional information on some feeds.
- %2F confusion on new api url
